Comments in code

	hopefully you have found the comments in the code helpful, you should be able to see my process fairly clearly once you have read the rest of this document.

Notes on Technical problems and how they were solved:

	Initially I had issues with the navigation bar, as you can see with the GIT Commit and branch; I decided to make a branch dedicated to try and solve the issue of the navigation bar being one location, and then staying fixed when you move down the screen, I did some research into this and I couldn't see a way of doing this with the navigation bar as it was (one page design) so created a branch so that I could have a play with it - risk free. This did not go well, all of the solutions that I could find involved using JQuery and the code that I found that used plain JavaScript just didn't work so I decided that it was better to have a working navigation bar than a faulty navigation bar that uses JQuery therefore I reverted back to the origin and deleted the branch.
	
JavaScript
	
	JS became the bane of my life throughout this project. I never got a single bit of it to work. Initially I was having some issues with it but I thought that I could solve them, I had planned on going to the lab session to ask some questions and try and get a few tips to see what I was doing wrong, however on the last lab of term I was horribly ill and therefore couldn't attend, I emailed about this to see if there were any other labs I could go to at the end of the week however I was still ill for a further week so couldn't attend these either. 
	
	I tried to solve the issues by doing some research on the errors being thrown however to no avail. I bet it is something dead simple that I just need an extra semi-colon or something like that. As you can tell I became quite frustrated with JS. I copied straight from the lab exercises - errors. I copied off Googles website - errors. Stack Overflow - errors. You get the picture. The lack of working JS hindered me throughout the website process. I have a google map in there that "should" work. I tried to make the navbar sticky which "should" have worked. I tried to make the navbar responsive, etc. I tried multiple things in there and nothing worked, hence my despair. 
	
The menu bar 

	Due to the one page design of my website the menu bar is arguably one of the most important attributes on the website. As you can probably see I used one of the labs as a template and then redeveloped it to suit my needs. The problem with doing this instead of using a standard menu bar with different pages then became apparent. Resizing the menu bar became an issue as I couldn’t find any tutorials on how to do it because the menu bar is vastly different from a standard one. This was made even more complicated by my issues with JS; therefore, to try and solve this I have manipulated it so that it doesn’t have to be resized and still just about works on mobile devices. 
	
	
Evidence of feedback and user testing

	During the Christmas holidays, I let my family have a play around on the website, one of the comments that they made was the colour scheme was quite boring. Now this is a fair point as all of the colours in the site are basically different shades of grey - however the reasoning for my chosen colour scheme was to not draw attention away from the content of the website. That is my reasoning anyway for why the website looks fairly bland. To try and address this issue I thought I would add in some logos for some of the companies that I have worked for - in addition to this I added in a shake function when you hover the mouse over the images almost as a little Easter egg - not sure it really keeps with the professional theme of the rest of the website but oh well. Additionally, I added custom scrollbar to jazz it up a bit, made the colour when you click on it maroon just to spice things up a bit.
