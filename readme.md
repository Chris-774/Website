Comments in code


Notes on Technical problems and how they were solved:

	Initially i had issues with the navigation bar, as you can see with the GIT Commit and branch; i decided to make a branch dedicated to try and solve the issue of the navigation bar being one location, and then staying fixed when you move down the screen, i did some research into this and i couldn't see a way of doing this with the navigation bar as it was (one page design) so created a branch so that i could have a play with it - risk free. This did not go well, all of the solutions that i could find involved using JQuery and the code that i found that used plain javascript just didn't work so i decided that it was better to have a working navigation bar than a faulty navigation bar that uses JQUery therefore i reverted back to the origin and deleted the branch.
	
Don't even get me started on Javascript. For some reason all JS code that i use doesn't seem to want to work. Take my firs t bit of JS for example; Parse error the keyword let is reserved 
	
The menu bar 

	Due to the one page design of my website the menubar is arguably one of the most important attributes on the website. As you can probably see i used one of the labs as a template and then redeveloped it to suit my needs. The problem with doing this instead of using a standard menubar with different pages then became apparent. Resizing the menubar became an issue as i couldnt find any tutorials on how to do it as the menubar is vastly different from a standard one. Therefore i have manipulated it so that it doenst have to be resized and still just about works on mobile devices. 
	
	
Evidence of feedback and user testing

	During the Christmas holidays i let my family have a play around on the website, one of the comments that they made was the colour scheme was quite boring. Now this is a fair point as all of the colours in the site are basically different shades of grey - however the reasoning for my chosen colour scheme was to not draw attention away from the content of the website. That is my reasoning anyway for why the website looks fairly bland. To try and address this issue i thought i would add in some logo's for some of the companies that i have worked for - in addition to this i added in a shake function when you hover the mouse over the images almost as a little easter egg. Additionally i added custom scrollbar to jazz it up a bit, made the colour when you click on it maroon just to spice things up a bit.
