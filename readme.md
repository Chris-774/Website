Notes on Technical problems and how they were solved:

	Initially i had issues with the navigation bar, as you can see with the GIT Commit and branch; i decided to make a branch dedicated to try and solve the issue of the navigation bar being one location, and then staying fixed when you move down the screen, i did some research into this and i couldn't see a way of doing this with the navigation bar as it was (one page design) so created a branch so that i could have a play with it - risk free. This did not go well, all of the solutions that i could find involved using JQuery and the code that i found that used plain javascript just didn't work so i decided that it was better to have a working navigation bar than a faulty navigation bar that uses JQUery therefore i reverted back to the origin and deleted the branch.
