			<strong>[June 2012]:</strong></p>
		<p>I have completed work experience for an ICT business called Laton Technical in Hastings. I contacted the business owner to request work experience and we arranged some dates. The reason I chose this business as I have an interest in computing therefore it seemed like a natural place for my work experience. During this period I learnt many things about computers and networking. The experience ranged from repairs for people’s personal computers at their houses and businesses, to going to Great Dixter House and gardens in Northiam where I helped install a wired network. This shows that I have experience in a variety of different aspects within the IT business, and can settle in quickly to work with other members of a team.</p>

			Before going off to university I was employed by Tenterden Garden Centre as a general assistant, my role varied depending on which staff were present and what needed doing. I operated the tills and in the not so busy periods I would clean, tidy and sweep to help maintain the garden centre. Due to the nature of retail work I was heavily involved in dealing with the public, therefore I feel my people skills have improved and I am now confident approaching customers.
